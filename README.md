# Skynet: The Clarity Programming Language

Clarity is a next-generation programming language designed to combine the best features of existing languages while addressing common pain points and maximizing developer productivity.

## Core Design Philosophy

Clarity is designed to combine the readability of Python, the functional elegance of Haskell, the strong typing of TypeScript, and the performance characteristics of Rustâ€”all while removing unnecessary complexity.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Syntax** - Code that reads closer to English while maintaining precision
- **Intelligent Type System** - Strong typing without the verbosity
- **Built-in Error Handling** - No more exception spaghetti
- **Memory Safety Without Complexity** - Automatic memory management with optional control
- **First-Class Concurrency** - Simple yet powerful parallel and async execution
- **Consistent Standard Library** - Comprehensive but logical API design
- **Interactive Documentation** - Help when you need it
- **Gradual Learning Curve** - Start simple, advance naturally
- **File Size Guidelines** - Keeping files between 200-300 lines for maintainability

## Project Status

This is a conceptual language design project. Clarity is not yet implemented as a working programming language.

## Documentation

Documentation will be added in the docs directory as the project evolves.
