# ClarityOS Kernel Components

The ClarityOS kernel directory contains core system components that provide the fundamental functionality of the operating system. These components handle critical tasks that require privileged access, specialized hardware interaction, and system-level coordination.

## Current Components

### Kernel Updater

The Kernel Updater (`kernel_updater.py`) is responsible for safely updating the critical components of ClarityOS, handling both hot updates (without restart) and staged updates (applied during restart).

**Features:**
- Safe update strategies for kernel components
- Component backup and restore
- Update staging for applying changes during restart
- Coordination with the System Evolution Agent

### Restart Manager

The Restart Manager (`restart_manager.py`) coordinates system restarts, ensuring they happen safely and successfully. It manages both full system restarts and component-level restarts.

**Features:**
- Restart policy enforcement
- State preservation across restarts
- Restart history tracking
- Coordinated shutdown and startup procedures

### AI-driven Init System (In Progress)

Located in the `ai_init` directory, this component provides an AI-driven replacement for traditional init systems, focusing on learning-based process management.

**Status:** Partially implemented.

### AI-driven Memory Manager (Planned)

Located in the `ai_mem` directory, this will provide intelligent memory management capabilities, optimizing memory allocation and usage based on learned patterns.

**Status:** Design phase, implementation not started.

### AI-driven Scheduler (Planned)

Located in the `ai_sched` directory, this will implement an intelligent task scheduler that improves on traditional scheduling algorithms through pattern learning and predictive optimization.

**Status:** Design phase, implementation not started.
