# ClarityOS - AI-Native Operating System Core

ClarityOS is an ambitious project to create a new computing paradigm centered around AI-driven interactions and system management. This directory contains the core implementation of ClarityOS.

## Overview

ClarityOS is designed with the following core principles:

- **AI-First Architecture**: AI agents are first-class citizens, not add-ons
- **Natural Language Interface**: Unified input model based on natural language
- **Context-Aware Computing**: System adapts to user needs and context
- **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Automated detection and repair of issues
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent resource allocation based on priorities

## Directory Structure

- `__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `main.py` - Main entry point for ClarityOS
- `core/` - Core system components
  - `message_bus.py` - Central communication system for all components
  - `agent_manager.py` - Agent lifecycle and management system
- `agents/` - AI agent implementations
  - `resource_agent.py` - Intelligent resource allocation agent
  - `intent_agent.py` - Natural language understanding agent

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running ClarityOS

To start the ClarityOS core:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python -m src.clarityos.main
```

## Architecture

### Message Bus

The message bus is the central nervous system of ClarityOS. It enables all components to communicate using a publish-subscribe model with the following features:

- Priority-based message processing
- Asynchronous communication
- Request-response patterns
- Message history for learning and debugging

### Agent System

The agent system provides a framework for AI agents to interact with the system:

- **Agent Manager**: Handles registration, lifecycle, and communication between agents
- **Resource Manager Agent**: Optimizes system resources based on priorities and patterns
- **User Intent Agent**: Processes natural language input to determine user intent

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See the [Skynet Project README](../../README.md) for general contribution guidelines.

For ClarityOS specific contributions:

1. Focus on enhancing the AI capabilities of the system
2. Improve the integration between agents and the core system
3. Extend the natural language understanding capabilities
4. Add new specialized agents for specific tasks
