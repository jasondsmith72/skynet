## Component Overview

### Knowledge Repository

The Knowledge Repository stores structured information about hardware components, including specifications, behaviors, interfaces, and performance characteristics. It maintains confidence scores for all knowledge and tracks learning history.

Usage:
```python
# Initialize repository
repo = HardwareKnowledgeRepository()
await repo.initialize()

# Find components by type
cpu_components = await repo.find_components(component_type="cpu")

# Update component knowledge
await repo.update_component_knowledge(
    component_id="cpu-123",
    knowledge_type="behaviors",
    knowledge_data={"power_states": {"idle": 5, "active": 65}},
    source="experimentation",
    confidence=0.8
)
```

### Documentation Ingestion

The Documentation Ingestion system processes hardware documentation to extract structured knowledge. It supports various document formats and uses natural language processing to identify relevant information.

Usage:
```python
# Initialize system
doc_system = DocumentationIngestion()
await doc_system.initialize()

# Process documentation
result = await doc_system.process_documentation(
    source="manufacturer_datasheet",
    content_type="text",
    content="CPU specifications: 16 cores, 32 threads, 3.8 GHz base frequency..."
)
```

### Interface Framework

The Interface Framework provides safe, direct interaction with hardware components. It includes interfaces for various hardware types and enforces safety boundaries through monitors.

Usage:
```python
# Initialize framework
interface = HardwareInterfaceFramework()
await interface.initialize()

# Interact with hardware
result = await interface.interact(
    interface_type="memory",
    operation="read",
    parameters={"address": 0x1000000, "size": 1024}
)
```

### Experimentation Framework

The Experimentation Framework enables controlled experiments with hardware to learn about its behavior and capabilities. It includes safety validation and result analysis.

Usage:
```python
# Initialize framework
experimentation = ExperimentationFramework()
await experimentation.initialize()

# Schedule an experiment
experiment = await experimentation.schedule_experiment(
    component_type="memory",
    specifications={"type": "DDR5", "capacity": 64},
    safety_level="high"
)

# Execute the experiment
result = await experimentation.execute_experiment(experiment["experiment_id"])
```

### Integration

The integration module demonstrates how all components work together, from hardware detection through learning and adaptation.

Usage:
```python
# Run the complete integration example
from clarityos.hardware.integration import main
await main()
```

## Boot Integration

The Hardware Learning System integrates with the ClarityOS boot process through `boot_integration.py` in the main directory. This enables hardware learning to start early in the boot process and continue throughout system operation.

## Documentation

For a complete overview of the Hardware Learning System architecture, methodologies, and capabilities, see the [Hardware Learning Overview](../docs/HARDWARE_LEARNING_OVERVIEW.md) document.

For detailed implementation plans and roadmap, see the [Hardware Learning Plan](../docs/HARDWARE_LEARNING_PLAN.md) document.

## Implementation Notes

1. The current implementation simulates hardware interactions for development and testing purposes.
2. In a production environment, these components would interface with actual hardware.
3. Safety monitors are essential and should always be used with hardware interfaces.
4. For maximum learning benefits, all components should be used together.

## Development Status

The Hardware Learning System is fully implemented with all core components. Future enhancements will focus on:

- Broader hardware support
- More sophisticated learning algorithms
- Enhanced documentation processing
- Cross-component learning
- Predictive behavior modeling
