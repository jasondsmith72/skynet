# ClarityOS Development Tools

This directory contains tools and components that enable ClarityOS to understand, modify, and extend its own codebase, working toward self-programming capabilities.

## Current Components

### Code Understanding System

The Code Understanding System enables ClarityOS to analyze and understand its own codebase, including code structure, relationships, and patterns. This is a foundational component for self-programming capabilities.

**Current capabilities:**
- Parse and analyze Python code
- Build a detailed model of the code structure (modules, classes, functions)
- Track relationships between code entities (inheritance, function calls)
- Query code entities by name and relationship

**Example usage:**
```python
from clarityos.development.code_understanding import CodeUnderstandingSystem

# Initialize the system
cus = CodeUnderstandingSystem("/path/to/codebase")
cus.initialize()

# Get the code model
code_model = cus.get_code_model()

# Find a specific entity
results = cus.find_entity("SystemEvolutionAgent")
```

See the [example script](examples/code_understanding_example.py) for a demonstration of analyzing the ClarityOS codebase.

### Code Generation System

The Code Generation System enables ClarityOS to generate and modify code based on specifications and patterns learned from existing code. This system works with the Code Understanding System to ensure generated code follows consistent patterns and conventions.

**Current capabilities:**
- Generate code from high-level specifications
- Create new components (agents, managers, interfaces)
- Apply consistent code style based on existing patterns
- Generate code that integrates with ClarityOS architecture

**Example usage:**
```python
from clarityos.development.code_understanding import CodeUnderstandingSystem
from clarityos.development.code_generation import CodeGenerationSystem

# Initialize the systems
cus = CodeUnderstandingSystem("/path/to/codebase")
cus.initialize()
cgs = CodeGenerationSystem(cus)

# Generate a new agent component
agent_code = cgs.generate_component(
    "DataAnalytics", 
    "agent",
    features=["Data Processing", "Statistical Analysis"]
)

# Generate a class from a detailed specification
class_spec = {
    "type": "class",
    "name": "TextProcessor",
    "doc": "Utility class for text processing.",
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "tokenize",
            "parameters": [{"name": "text", "type": "str"}],
            "return_type": "List[str]",
            "body": "return text.split()"
        }
    ]
}
class_code = cgs.generate_code(class_spec)
```

See the [example script](examples/code_generation_example.py) for a demonstration of code generation capabilities.

### Development Environment Integration

The Development Environment Integration system enables ClarityOS to interact with development tools, version control, and build systems. This is essential for managing its own source code and deployment.

**Current capabilities:**
- Interact with Git repositories (commit, push, pull, branch)
- Run tests and analyze test results
- Use linters for static code analysis
- Implement, test, and commit changes in a single workflow

**Example usage:**
```python
from clarityos.development.environment_integration import EnvironmentIntegrationSystem

# Initialize the system
env_system = EnvironmentIntegrationSystem("/path/to/repo")

# Get repository status
status = env_system.git.status()
print(f"Current branch: {status['branch']}")
print(f"Modified files: {status['files']['modified']}")

# Implement and commit a change
result = env_system.implement_and_commit(
    "path/to/file.py",
    "# New file content\nprint('Hello, World!')",
    "Add new hello world script",
    run_tests=True,
    push=False
)

# Check the result
if result["success"]:
    print("Change successfully implemented and committed")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['steps']}")
```

See the [example script](examples/environment_integration_example.py) for a demonstration of environment integration capabilities.

## Planned Components

According to the [Self-Programming Roadmap](../docs/SELF-PROGRAMMING-ROADMAP.md), the following components will be developed:

### Self-Improvement Framework

This system will provide mechanisms for identifying improvement opportunities within ClarityOS and safely implementing them.

**Planned capabilities:**
- Code quality assessment
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Security vulnerability detection
- Architecture optimization planning
- Incremental improvement management

## Next Development Steps

The following tasks should be prioritized for the next development phase:

1. **Enhance the Development Environment Integration**
   - Add support for more complex Git operations (merge, rebase)
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Create comprehensive test management
   - Develop deployment automation

2. **Enhance the Code Generation System**
   - Add support for code modification (in addition to generation)
   - Implement validation of generated code
   - Create mechanisms for testing generated code
   - Develop more advanced template capabilities

3. **Create the Self-Improvement Framework Foundation**
   - Develop code quality metrics
   - Implement basic refactoring capabilities
   - Create test coverage analysis
   - Implement performance analysis

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to the self-programming capabilities of ClarityOS, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Safety First**
   - All self-programming components must include validation and verification steps
   - Implement robust error handling for all operations
   - Create automatic rollback capabilities for failed operations
   - Add comprehensive logging for all code-modifying actions

2. **Modularity**
   - Design components with clear interfaces and separation of concerns
   - Ensure each component can function independently when possible
   - Use the Message Bus for inter-component communication
   - Allow for easy replacement or enhancement of individual components

3. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all self-programming components
   - Implement integration tests for component interactions
   - Develop safety tests that verify system integrity during and after operations
   - Use property-based testing for code generation and modification

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all public APIs and their parameters
   - Include usage examples for each component
   - Explain the safety mechanisms and their guarantees
   - Document the architectural patterns used in the implementation
