# ClarityOS Self-Programming Demonstrations

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate the self-programming capabilities of ClarityOS. These examples show how ClarityOS can understand, modify, and extend its own codebase with increasing autonomy.

## Available Demonstrations

### 1. Code Understanding Example
**File:** `code_understanding_example.py`

Demonstrates the Code Understanding System, which analyzes the ClarityOS codebase to build a detailed model of its structure, relationships, and patterns. This is the foundation for self-programming capabilities.

**To run:**
```bash
python -m src.clarityos.development.examples.code_understanding_example
```

### 2. Code Generation Example
**File:** `code_generation_example.py`

Demonstrates the Code Generation System, which generates new code based on specifications and patterns learned from existing code. This shows how ClarityOS can create new components that follow consistent patterns and integrate with the existing architecture.

**To run:**
```bash
python -m src.clarityos.development.examples.code_generation_example
```

### 3. Environment Integration Example
**File:** `environment_integration_example.py`

Demonstrates the Development Environment Integration System, which allows ClarityOS to interact with Git repositories, run tests, and manage its own codebase. This shows how ClarityOS can manage its own development environment.

**To run:**
```bash
python -m src.clarityos.development.examples.environment_integration_example
```

### 4. Self-Programming Demonstration
**File:** `self_programming_demonstration.py`

Integrates all the above systems to demonstrate a complete self-programming workflow, from analyzing the codebase to identifying improvement opportunities, generating new code, testing it, and preparing for integration. This represents the future vision of ClarityOS as a self-programming system.

**To run:**
```bash
python -m src.clarityos.development.examples.self_programming_demonstration
```

## Notes on the Demonstrations

- These demonstrations are simulations that show the capabilities and workflow without making actual modifications to the repository (except for temporary files that are cleaned up).
- The full self-programming capabilities are still under development, with the roadmap detailed in the [Self-Programming Roadmap](../../docs/SELF-PROGRAMMING-ROADMAP.md) document.
- These examples represent early prototypes of the systems that will eventually enable ClarityOS to fully program itself.

## Next Development Steps

The next steps in developing the self-programming capabilities demonstrated here include:

1. **Tighter Integration** between the various systems
2. **More Sophisticated Analysis** to identify real improvement opportunities
3. **Advanced Code Generation** with better pattern learning
4. **Safe Testing Framework** for validating generated code
5. **Autonomous Decision Making** for determining when and how to make changes

These demonstrations provide a foundation for understanding how these capabilities will work together as they mature.

## Contribution

If you're interested in contributing to the self-programming capabilities of ClarityOS, these examples are a good place to start. They show the current state of the systems and how they interact, which can help you understand where improvements are needed.

See the [Development README](../README.md) for more information on the self-programming components and guidelines for contributing.
