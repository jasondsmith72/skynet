# ClarityOS: AI-Native Operating System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation strategy for transitioning ClarityOS from an application running on conventional operating systems to a true AI-native operating system where artificial intelligence is the fundamental organizing principle.

## Project Vision Refresh

ClarityOS represents a paradigm shift in computing by placing AI at the core of the operating system rather than as an application layer.
