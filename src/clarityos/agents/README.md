# ClarityOS Agent System

The ClarityOS agent system contains specialized AI agents that perform various functions within the operating system. Each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of system operation and management.

## System Evolution Agent

The System Evolution Agent is responsible for managing the evolution and updates of ClarityOS over time. It enables the system to securely update itself, learn from past updates, and evolve its capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Update Management**: Monitors available updates from trusted sources
- **Component Registry**: Maintains a registry of system components and their versions
- **Version Tracking**: Tracks version history and provides rollback capabilities
- **Update Validation**: Verifies updates for security and compatibility
- **Restart Management**: Coordinates with Restart Manager for updates requiring restart

### Usage Examples

Checking for updates:
```python
# Request update check manually
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/check",
    {
        "force": True,  # Force check regardless of schedule
        "source": "official"  # Specify update source (optional)
    }
)
```

Applying an update:
```python
# Apply a specific update
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/apply",
    {
        "update_id": "update_12345"
    }
)
```

Rolling back an update:
```python
# Rollback to a previous version
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/rollback",
    {
        "component": "resource_agent",
        "version": "1.2.3"  # Optional, rolls back to previous version if not specified
    }
)
```

### Related Components

The System Evolution Agent works with these related components:

1. **Kernel Updater**: Handles updates to critical kernel components
2. **Restart Manager**: Manages system restarts for updates that require it

## Kernel Updater

The Kernel Updater is responsible for safely updating the critical kernel components of ClarityOS, such as the Message Bus, Agent Manager, and core hardware interfaces.

### Key Features

- **Safe Update Strategies**: 
  - Hot Updates: Updates components without system restart
  - Staged Updates: Prepares updates to be applied during restart
- **Backup Creation**: Creates backups before applying updates
- **Rollback Support**: Restores from backups if updates fail
- **Staged Update Management**: Applies staged updates during system boot

## Restart Manager

The Restart Manager handles system restarts in a safe and controlled manner, coordinating the shutdown and startup procedures.

### Key Features

- **Restart Policies**: Enforces policies to prevent excessive restarts
- **State Preservation**: Saves system state before restart and restores it afterward
- **Component Restart**: Supports restarting specific components without full system restart
- **Restart History**: Maintains a history of system restarts for diagnostics
- **Restart Coordination**: Ensures all components are prepared for restart

## Integration with Other Agents

The System Evolution Agent and its components integrate with other ClarityOS agents:

- **Resource Manager Agent**: Coordinates resource allocation during updates
- **Intent Agent**: Provides natural language interface for managing updates
- **Hardware Learning Agent**: Leverages hardware knowledge for targeted updates

## Future Development

Upcoming features for the System Evolution system include:

1. **Self-Evolution**: The ability for the system to identify needed improvements and update itself
2. **Differential Updates**: More efficient updates by transferring only changed components
3. **Enhanced Validation**: More sophisticated verification of updates using AI-driven testing
4. **Predictive Updates**: Anticipating when updates will be needed based on system patterns
5. **Distributed Updates**: Coordinating updates across multiple instances of ClarityOS
