# ClarityOS Agent System

The ClarityOS agent system contains specialized AI agents that perform various functions within the operating system. Each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of system operation and management.

## System Evolution Agent

The System Evolution Agent is responsible for managing the evolution and updates of ClarityOS over time. It enables the system to securely update itself, learn from past updates, and evolve its capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Update Management**: Monitors available updates from trusted sources
- **Component Registry**: Maintains a registry of system components and their versions
- **Version Tracking**: Tracks version history and provides rollback capabilities
- **Update Validation**: Verifies updates for security and compatibility
- **Restart Management**: Coordinates with Restart Manager for updates requiring restart

### Usage Examples

Checking for updates:
```python
# Request update check manually
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/check",
    {
        "force": True,  # Force check regardless of schedule
        "source": "official"  # Specify update source (optional)
    }
)
```

Applying an update:
```python
# Apply a specific update
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/apply",
    {
        "update_id": "update_12345"
    }
)
```

Rolling back an update:
```python
# Rollback to a previous version
await message_bus.publish(
    "system/update/rollback",
    {
        "component": "resource_agent",
        "version": "1.2.3"  # Optional, rolls back to previous version if not specified
    }
)
```

### Related Components

The System Evolution Agent works with these related components:

1. **Kernel Updater**: Handles updates to critical kernel components
2. **Restart Manager**: Manages system restarts for updates that require it

## Kernel Updater

The Kernel Updater is responsible for safely updating the critical kernel components of ClarityOS, such as the Message Bus, Agent Manager, and core hardware interfaces.

### Key Features

- **Safe Update Strategies**: 
  - Hot Updates: Updates components without system restart
  - Staged Updates: Prepares updates to be applied during restart
- **Backup Creation**: Creates backups before applying updates
- **Rollback Support**: Restores from backups if updates fail
- **Staged Update Management**: Applies staged updates during system boot

## Restart Manager

The Restart Manager handles system restarts in a safe and controlled manner, coordinating the shutdown and startup procedures.

### Key Features

- **Restart Policies**: Enforces policies to prevent excessive restarts
- **State Preservation**: Saves system state before restart and restores it afterward
- **Component Restart**: Supports restarting specific components without full system restart
- **Restart History**: Maintains a history of system restarts for diagnostics
- **Restart Coordination**: Ensures all components are prepared for restart

## Integration with Other Agents

The System Evolution Agent and its components integrate with other ClarityOS agents:

- **Resource Manager Agent**: Coordinates resource allocation during updates
- **Intent Agent**: Provides natural language interface for managing updates
- **Hardware Learning Agent**: Leverages hardware knowledge for targeted updates

## Next Development Steps

To enhance the System Evolution capabilities of ClarityOS, the following tasks need to be completed:

1. **Update Validation & Verification System**
   - Implement cryptographic verification of update packages
   - Add compatibility checking against current system state
   - Create AI-driven validation tests to verify updates work correctly
   - Develop update simulation in isolated environment before application
   - Implementation priority: **HIGH**

2. **Improved Rollback System**
   - Enhance state preservation before updates
   - Create comprehensive component dependency tracking
   - Add automatic rollback triggers based on system health monitoring
   - Implement partial rollbacks for multi-component updates
   - Implementation priority: **HIGH**

3. **Differential Update System**
   - Create update package format supporting deltas rather than full replacements
   - Implement efficient difference calculation between versions
   - Add bandwidth and storage optimization for update process
   - Develop component-specific differential strategies
   - Implementation priority: **MEDIUM**

4. **Self-Evolution Capabilities**
   - Create system for identifying improvement opportunities
   - Implement automated update generation for self-improvement
   - Add learning from past update successes and failures
   - Develop user feedback integration into update process
   - Implementation priority: **MEDIUM**

5. **Advanced Update Distribution**
   - Implement staged rollout capabilities for critical updates
   - Add peer-to-peer update distribution for efficient networking
   - Create update channels (stable, beta, experimental)
   - Develop distributed verification of update integrity
   - Implementation priority: **LOW**

## Integration Points

To fully realize the System Evolution capabilities, integration with other ClarityOS components is needed:

1. **Hardware Learning System**
   - Use hardware knowledge to tailor updates to specific hardware
   - Leverage experimentation framework for update testing
   - Integrate hardware safety monitoring during update process

2. **Message Bus**
   - Enhance message types for update-related events
   - Implement priority routing for critical update notifications
   - Add persistent message support for update operations

3. **AI Init System**
   - Coordinate process management during updates
   - Integrate with restart procedures
   - Leverage learning capabilities for optimizing update timing

4. **User Intent System**
   - Develop natural language interface for update management
   - Create intent-based update policies (e.g., "keep system secure" = auto security updates)
   - Implement context-aware update scheduling

## Getting Started with Development

To begin working on System Evolution improvements:

1. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository if you haven't already
   git clone https://github.com/jasondsmith72/skynet.git
   cd skynet

   # Run ClarityOS in development mode
   python -m src.clarityos.boot
   ```

2. **Familiarize yourself with the System Evolution components**
   - Review `system_evolution_agent.py`, `kernel_updater.py`, and `restart_manager.py`
   - Understand message types used for update operations
   - Review the update operation workflow

3. **Start with small improvements**
   - Enhance update validation in `system_evolution_agent.py`
   - Improve backup/restore functionality in `kernel_updater.py`
   - Add more sophisticated restart policies in `restart_manager.py`

4. **Run tests**
