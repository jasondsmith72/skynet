# MSP Integration Module

This module provides integration capabilities between the Skynet Project (Clarity/ClarityOS) and common MSP platforms and tools.

## Overview

MSP operations require seamless integration with various platforms including PSA (Professional Services Automation), RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management), and ticketing systems. This module serves as a bridge between the AI-driven capabilities of the Skynet Project and the practical operational needs of MSPs.

## Key Components

1. **Platform Connectors**: Standardized interfaces for connecting to MSP platforms
   - ConnectWise Manage/Automate
   - Datto RMM/Autotask
   - Kaseya VSA/BMS
   - SolarWinds N-Central/MSP Manager
   - NinjaOne
   - Generic REST API connector

2. **Data Transformers**: Utilities for transforming data between systems
   - Monitoring data normalization
   - Alert standardization
   - Ticket creation templates
   - Inventory mapping

3. **Automated Workflows**: Pre-built automation for common MSP tasks
   - Proactive remediation sequences
   - Ticket triage and categorization
   - SLA tracking and prioritization
   - Documentation generation

4. **Security Framework**: Components ensuring secure multi-tenant operations
   - Client data isolation
   - Credential management
   - Audit logging for actions
   - Permission enforcement

## Usage

The module is designed to be used in two primary ways:

1. **Standalone Mode**: Connect existing MSP tools to Skynet AI capabilities
2. **Integrated Mode**: Full integration within ClarityOS environment

    company_id: "your_company"
    public_key: "your_public_key"
    private_key: "your_private_key"
    client_id: "your_client_id"
  
  datto:
    url: "https://your-instance.autotask.net"
    api_key: "your_api_key"
```
