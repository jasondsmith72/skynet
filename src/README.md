# Skynet Project - Source Code

This directory contains the implementation code for the Skynet Project.

## Directory Structure

- `clarity/` - Clarity programming language implementation
  - `compiler/` - Language parser and compiler components
  - `runtime/` - Execution environment and diagnostic tools
  - `diagnostics/` - Error detection and analysis
  - `healing/` - Self-healing mechanisms
  - `examples/` - Example Clarity programs
  - `tests/` - Test suite
  - `docs/` - Documentation

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Demo

To see the self-healing system in action:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python -m src.clarity.test_driver
```

This will demonstrate Clarity's self-healing capabilities on several example files.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python -m src.clarity.tests.test_self_healing
```

## Core Features

### Self-Healing Capabilities

The Clarity implementation focuses on the language's self-healing capabilities:

1. **Error Detection** - Identify syntax, type, reference, and logic errors
2. **Error Analysis** - Determine root causes and classify error patterns
3. **Automated Healing** - Apply appropriate fixes to correct errors
4. **Learning System** - Improve healing strategies based on successes and failures

### AI Integration

The language includes native AI capabilities:

1. **Intent Declaration** - Specify what code should do, not just how
2. **Data Extraction** - Use natural language to extract and transform data
3. **Visualization Generation** - Create visualizations using natural language descriptions
4. **Context-Aware Execution** - Runtime that understands the broader context of operations

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Parser** - Complete the language grammar implementation
2. **Improve Healing Strategies** - Add more sophisticated error correction
3. **Implement Learning System** - Create the feedback loop for improving healing
4. **Build Runtime** - Develop full execution environment

See the [implementation plan](../docs/implementation/roadmap.md) for a detailed development roadmap.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See the [Skynet Project README](../README.md) for general contribution guidelines.

For Clarity language specific contributions:

1. Focus on core self-healing capabilities
2. Add test cases for new error patterns
3. Implement additional healing strategies
4. Improve documentation and examples
