# ClarityOS Kernel Self-Update System

This document explains how ClarityOS implements self-updating kernel capabilities, allowing the AI-driven operating system to evolve and improve itself autonomously.

## System Overview

The kernel self-update system consists of several interconnected components that work together to enable ClarityOS to safely update its core components while maintaining system stability.

### Key Components

1. **System Evolution Agent (`system_evolution_agent.py`)**
   - Monitors for available updates from trusted sources
   - Manages the update lifecycle (discovery, validation, application, testing)
   - Maintains a registry of system components and their versions
   - Provides rollback capabilities in case of failed updates

2. **Kernel Updater (`kernel_updater.py`)**
   - Specialized module for handling updates to critical kernel components
   - Implements safe update strategies (hot update vs. restart-based update)
   - Creates backups before modifying kernel components
   - Applies staged kernel updates during system boot

3. **Restart Manager (`restart_manager.py`)**
   - Handles system restart requests for updates and other reasons
   - Manages graceful shutdown and restart procedures
   - Preserves system state across restarts
   - Verifies update completion after restart

4. **Restart Script (`restart_clarityos.py`)**
   - Standalone script executed during restart process
   - Applies pending kernel updates before the main system starts
   - Ensures clean system initialization after updates
   - Reports update results to the main system

## Update Process Flow

The kernel self-update process follows these steps:

### 1. Update Discovery

The System Evolution Agent periodically checks for updates by:
- Connecting to trusted update sources
- Comparing available versions with currently installed versions
- Filtering updates based on relevance and system compatibility
- Announcing available updates to the system

```
[System Evolution Agent] → Checks update sources → Discovers updates → Announces available updates
```

### 2. Update Decision

The system decides whether to apply updates based on:
- Update priority (critical, high, medium, low)
- System configuration (automatic vs. manual updates)
- Current system state and activity
- User/administrator preferences

For automatic updates:
```
[System Evolution Agent] → Filters critical updates → Prepares update plan
```

For manual updates:
```
[User] → Requests update → [System Evolution Agent] → Prepares update plan
```

### 3. Update Preparation

Before applying any update, the system:
- Creates backups of components to be updated
- Validates update package integrity (checksums, signatures)
- Verifies dependency compatibility
- Stages the update for application

```
[System Evolution Agent] → Creates backups → Validates update → Stages update
```

### 4. Update Application

For non-kernel components:
```
[System Evolution Agent] → Applies update directly → Tests → Finalizes or rolls back
```

For kernel components:
```
[Kernel Updater] → Stages update → [Restart Manager] → Schedules restart → System shutdown
→ [Restart Script] → Applies kernel updates → Starts updated system
```

### 5. Validation and Finalization

After applying updates:
- The system runs tests to verify functionality
- If tests pass, the update is finalized
- If tests fail, the update is rolled back
- Update status is recorded in system history

```
[System Evolution Agent] → Runs tests → Records results → [If failed: Rolls back]
```

## Safety Measures

The kernel self-update system incorporates multiple safety measures:

1. **Component Backups**
   - Every component is backed up before modification
   - Backups are preserved for a configurable period
   - Multiple backup versions are maintained for critical components

2. **Staged Updates**
   - Kernel updates are staged rather than applied directly
   - Updates are verified before being applied to active components
   - Application occurs during controlled system restart

3. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Component dependencies are tracked and verified
   - Updates are ordered to maintain system consistency
   - Interdependent components are updated together

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Updates undergo testing before finalization
   - Tests verify both component functionality and system integration
   - Failed tests trigger automatic rollback

5. **Rollback Capabilities**
   - All updates can be rolled back if problems are detected
   - Rollback can occur automatically or manually
   - System state is preserved during rollback

6. **Update Journaling**
   - All update activities are logged with detailed information
   - Update history is maintained for auditing and troubleshooting
   - Failed updates are analyzed to prevent similar issues

## Integration with ClarityOS

The kernel self-update system integrates with other ClarityOS components:

1. **Message Bus Integration**
   - Update events are published on the system message bus
   - Components can subscribe to update notifications
   - Communication is prioritized based on update criticality

2. **Agent Manager Integration**
   - The System Evolution Agent is managed by the Agent Manager
   - Agent lifecycle follows standard ClarityOS agent patterns
   - Agent can be controlled through standard agent interfaces

3. **Resource Agent Coordination**
   - Update scheduling considers resource availability
   - Resource Agent can prioritize update operations when needed
   - System load is monitored during update application

4. **User Intent Integration**
   - User can request updates through natural language
   - Intent Agent translates update requests to system commands
   - Update status is communicated in user-friendly language

## Configuration Options

The kernel self-update system offers several configuration options:

1. **Update Sources**
   - Define trusted sources for updates
   - Configure authentication for secure update retrieval
   - Set update check frequency

2. **Automatic Updates**
   - Enable/disable automatic updates
   - Specify which priority levels are eligible for auto-update
   - Set maintenance windows for update application

3. **Safety Parameters**
   - Configure backup retention policies
   - Set test timeouts and verification criteria
   - Define rollback thresholds

4. **Restart Behavior**
   - Control restart timing and notifications
   - Configure automatic vs. manual restart approval
   - Set pre-restart preparation time

## Example: Updating the Message Bus Component

Here's how the system would handle an update to the core message bus component:

1. System Evolution Agent discovers message_bus update (version 0.2.0)
2. Update is identified as a kernel component update (high priority)
3. System Evolution Agent creates a backup of the current message_bus
4. Kernel Updater stages the update and creates an update plan
5. Restart Manager schedules a system restart with 60 seconds notice
6. System completes current operations and prepares for shutdown
7. System shuts down and restart script executes
8. Restart script applies the staged message_bus update
9. System restarts with new message_bus version
10. Update completion is verified and announced to the system

## Getting Started

To enable the kernel self-update capability:

1. Add the System Evolution Agent to your ClarityOS setup:
   ```python
   # In your agent registration code
   await agent_manager.register_agent(
       name="System Evolution",
       module_path="src.clarityos.agents.update_system.evolution_agent.SystemEvolutionAgent",
       description="Manages system updates and evolution",
       config={
           "auto_update": True,
           "auto_update_priorities": ["CRITICAL"],
           "update_check_interval": 86400,
           "system_root": project_root
       },
       auto_start=True
   )
   ```

2. Add the Restart Manager to your ClarityOS setup:
   ```python
   # In your initialization code
   restart_manager = RestartManager({
       "system_root": project_root,
       "main_script": "run_clarityos.py"
   })
   await restart_manager.start()
   ```

3. Ensure the restart script is available in your project root
   ```bash
   cp restart_clarityos.py /path/to/your/project/
   chmod +x /path/to/your/project/restart_clarityos.py
   ```

4. Create necessary directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/backups/kernel
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/state
   ```

## Conclusion

The kernel self-update capability is a crucial feature of ClarityOS that enables the system to evolve and improve itself over time. By implementing safe, controlled update mechanisms, ClarityOS can maintain stability while incorporating new features, optimizations, and security improvements.

This capability forms the foundation for true AI-driven system evolution, allowing ClarityOS to adapt to changing requirements and improve its own functionality autonomously.
