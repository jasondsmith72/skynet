# Practical Implementation Steps

## Phase 1: Extend ClarityOS Framework (1-2 Months)

### 1. Enhance the Existing Message Bus Architecture
- Optimize the current system_bus implementation for lower latency
- Add a hardware abstraction layer to interface with device drivers
- Implement priority-based scheduling for critical system messages
- Add reliability features like message persistence and delivery guarantees

```python
# Example enhancement to message bus for hardware interface
class HardwareMessageBus(MessageBus):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.hardware_interfaces = {}
        
    async def register_hardware_interface(self, device_type, interface):
        self.hardware_interfaces[device_type] = interface
        
    async def send_hardware_command(self, device_type, command, data):
        if device_type not in self.hardware_interfaces:
            raise DeviceNotFoundError(f"No interface for {device_type}")
            
        response = await self.hardware_interfaces[device_type].execute(command, data)
        return response
```

### 2. Develop a Bootable Environment
