## Adaptive Implementation Approach

The implementation strategy for Clarity emphasizes iterative development with regular feedback cycles:

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Core language features implemented independently
   - Pluggable components for extensibility
   - Clear interfaces between compiler phases

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with a small, usable subset of the language
   - Add features incrementally
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Regular community feedback sessions
   - Early adopter testing program
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Dogfooding the language in its own development

## Platform Support

Initial implementation will focus on the following platforms:

- **Tier 1** (fully supported):
  - Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
  - macOS (x86_64, ARM64)
  - Windows (x86_64)

- **Tier 2** (partially supported):
  - BSD variants
  - Windows ARM64
  - WebAssembly targets

- **Planned Future Support**:
  - Mobile platforms
  - Embedded systems
  - Specialized hardware (GPUs, FPGAs)

## Community Involvement

The Clarity implementation will be open source with a focus on building a strong community:

- **Contributor Guidelines**
  - Clear contribution process
  - Coding standards
  - Review procedures
  - Mentoring for new contributors

- **Governance Model**

  - RFC process for significant changes
  - Working groups for specialized topics
  - Transparent roadmap planning

- **Community Resources**
  - Discussion forums
  - Regular online meetups
  - Educational content
  - Hackathons and coding challenges

## Initial Use Cases

The following use cases will guide initial development:

1. **Web Service Development**
   - RESTful APIs
   - GraphQL services
   - Real-time applications
   - Microservice architectures

2. **Data Processing**
