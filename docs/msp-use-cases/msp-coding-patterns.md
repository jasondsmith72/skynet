# MSP Coding Patterns in Clarity

This directory contains example patterns for common MSP programming tasks using Clarity.

## Overview

Each example demonstrates how Clarity's unique features can simplify complex MSP operations while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability.

## Available Patterns

1. [Client Configuration Management](patterns/client-configuration.md) - Manage client configurations with inheritance and overrides
2. [Batch Client Processing](patterns/batch-processing.md) - Process operations across multiple clients with safety controls
3. [Remote Script Execution](patterns/remote-execution.md) - Securely execute scripts on remote client machines
4. [Automated Reporting](patterns/automated-reporting.md) - Generate client-specific reports
5. [Device Inventory Management](patterns/device-inventory.md) - Track and manage client devices
6. [Managed Services Integration](patterns/msp-integration.md) - Integrate with RMM/PSA tools

## Key Features Demonstrated

These patterns showcase several Clarity features particularly useful for MSPs:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Isolate client data while sharing code
- **Tenant contexts** - Execute operations in a client's security context
- **Batch processing** - Process multiple clients safely and efficiently
- **Audit logging** - Automatic tracking of security-sensitive operations
- **Scheduled tasks** - Declarative scheduling with cron-like syntax
- **Error handling** - Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Permission control** - Fine-grained access control
- **AI integration** - Use AI for generating reports and recommendations

## Best Practices

The examples follow these MSP best practices:

- **Client isolation** - Strict separation of client data
- **Careful batch operations** - Validation before bulk actions
- **Comprehensive logging** - Track all sensitive operations
- **Defensive coding** - Anticipate and handle failures gracefully
- **Security by default** - Always prioritize secure operations
