# Skynet MSP Integration

## Overview

The Skynet MSP Integration module extends the core Skynet Project to provide practical integration with common MSP platforms. It leverages AI-driven monitoring and automated remediation to enhance operational efficiency for Managed Service Providers.

## Key Features

1. **Platform Connectors**: Connect to common MSP platforms
   - ConnectWise Manage/Automate integration
   - Expandable architecture for additional platforms (Datto, Kaseya, etc.)

2. **AI-Driven Monitoring**: Intelligent anomaly detection
   - Machine learning-based abnormal pattern detection
   - Adapt to client-specific normal behavior
   - Trend analysis and predictive insights

3. **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing capabilities
   - Configurable remediation actions
   - Permission-based execution
   - Audit trail for all automated actions

4. **Dashboard Interface**: Visual monitoring and management
   - Client health overview
   - Anomaly visualization
   - Manual remediation controls

## Architecture

The MSP Integration module follows a modular design:

1. **Connector Layer**: Platform-specific integration adapters
2. **Monitoring Engine**: Data collection and analysis
3. **Remediation Framework**: Action execution and verification
4. **Configuration System**: Settings and permissions management
5. **Dashboard**: User interface for monitoring and control

## Integration with Skynet Core

This module demonstrates how the core Skynet concepts of AI-native programming and system intelligence apply to practical MSP operations:

- **Intent-Based Programming**: Express desired system state, not implementation details
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Clear, understandable automation logic
- **Runtime AI Agents**: Intelligent monitoring and remediation agents
- **Self-Healing System**: Automatic detection and repair of issues

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasondsmith72/skynet.git
cd skynet
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-msp.txt
```

3. Configure platform connections:
```bash
cd src/msp_integration/examples
python connectwise_integration.py
# This will create a config.yaml file - edit with your credentials
```

### Running the Dashboard

The dashboard provides a web interface for monitoring:

```bash
cd src/msp_integration/examples
python dashboard.py
```

This will start a web server on http://localhost:5000 by default.

### Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to configure:

- Platform credentials
- Client information
- Monitoring settings
- Dashboard configuration

Example configuration:

```yaml
platforms:
  connectwise:
    url: "https://your-instance.connectwise.com"
    company_id: "your_company"
    public_key: "your_public_key" 
    private_key: "your_private_key"
    client_id: "your_client_id"
    automate_url: "https://your-instance.automate.net"

monitoring:
  scan_interval: 15  # minutes
  anomaly_threshold: 0.8
  auto_remediate: false

clients:
  - id: "client1"
    name: "Client One"
    enabled: true
  - id: "client2" 
    name: "Client Two"
    enabled: false

dashboard:
  update_interval: 5  # minutes
  port: 5000
  host: "0.0.0.0"
```

## Practical Use Cases

### Proactive Issue Resolution

1. Anomaly detection identifies potential disk space issues on a client server
2. System automatically clears temporary files to free up space
3. Ticket is created with details of the action and results
4. Client never experiences downtime

### Intelligent Alert Management

1. System learns normal operating patterns for each client
2. Only genuinely abnormal conditions generate alerts
3. Technicians focus on real issues, not false positives
4. Client satisfaction improves with faster resolution times

### Performance Optimization

1. System identifies resource usage patterns across client environments
2. Recommendations for optimization are generated
3. Changes can be implemented automatically or manually
4. Clients benefit from improved system performance

## Extending the System

The MSP Integration module is designed for extension:

1. **New Platform Connectors**: Implement additional platform connectors by extending the base connector interfaces
2. **Custom Remediation Actions**: Add specialized remediation actions for your environment
3. **Enhanced Dashboard**: Extend the web interface with additional visualizations and controls
4. **Integration with Clarity Language**: Implement Clarity language scripts for more sophisticated automation

## Future Directions

1. **Cross-Client Learning**: Leverage insights from the entire client base while maintaining data isolation
2. **Advanced Prediction Models**: Move from anomaly detection to specific issue prediction
3. **Natural Language Interface**: Implement chat-based interaction for technicians
4. **Client Self-Service**: Provide limited dashboard access for clients to view their own systems
5. **Integration with Clarity OS**: Full integration with the AI-native operating system
